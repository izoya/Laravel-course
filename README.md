### Greetings!
I'm Zoya, the developer of this news aggregator website.
I've created it for study and portfolio purposes.

##### Here's a technology stack and some key features of the project:
    * Laravel 8 + MySQL + JavaScript + Bootstrap
    * Admin panel with HTML-editor and file manager
    * Facebook & Vkontakte authentication using Laravel Socialite 
    * News content is being collected via rss-feed parsing
    * Parsing jobs are queued through Redis


##### Try on admin features
Login with admin@mail.com and password '123' to get access to the Admin panel.
